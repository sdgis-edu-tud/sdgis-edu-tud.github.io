Per questo motivo la mappa di mercatore e’ stata molto criticata\nOn the Mercator projection, greenland appears to be roughly the same size as Africa. In reality, Greenland is 0.8 million sq. miles, and Africa is 11.6 million sq. miles, nearly 14 and a half times larger.\nGerardus Mercator revolutionized map making2. His Mercator projection map, invented in 1569, was the primary map that navigators used for years. It’s the form that many maps still come in today. And the name he chose for his massive collection of maps — “Atlas” — is widely used.\nThis map was designed only for navigation, but when used incorrectly, can cause people to misudnderstand the sizes of continents and nations.\nHis new map was a revelation, because:\n\nthe projection kept the latitude and longitude lines at consistent 90 degree angles.\nmade it easier for sailors to plot their course without constantly adjusting for mapping mistakes.\nEasier to see the relationships between landmasses.\nThe downside was that it distorted the size of land masses, particularly near the poles\nThis map was designed only for navigation, but when used incorrectly, can cause people to misudnderstand the sizes of continents and nations.\n\nThat achievement was followed by the publication of Mercator’s Atlas. Though it wasn’t the first book of maps, the name Mercator chose came to define the type of book.\nIn recent years, the Mercator projection has come under fire for distorting the real shape of the world’s continents — objects closer to the poles appear larger than they should. That results in North America looking larger than Africa, or China looking smaller than Greenland, when really the opposite is true.\n\n\n\n\nGeographic Misconceptions: The distortion inherent in the Mercator projection has led to widespread misconceptions. People have the wrong idea about the relative size of countries and continents. Africa, for example, is vastly larger than Greenland in reality, yet on a Mercator map, they comparable in size. This skewed perception has implications for how people understand global geography. It can reinforce Eurocentric views of the world. Europe appears larger and more centrally located than it is in reality.\nCultural and Political Impacts: The Mercator projection has been critiqued for reinforcing colonial and imperialist worldviews. The projection enlarges Europe and North America while minimizing the Global South. This effect perpetuates a sense of dominance and importance for the countries in the Northern Hemisphere. This bias can subtly influence political and cultural attitudes. It contributes to a worldview that overemphasizes the power and significance of the North at the expense of the South.\nEducational Consequences: The Mercator projection’s prevalence in educational settings, particularly in classrooms, has had lasting impacts. These impacts affect students’ understanding of world geography. The distorted sizes of continents and countries can lead to misconceptions that persist into adulthood. These misconceptions can influence everything from personal worldviews to policy decisions. An inaccurate understanding of geography can lead to flawed strategic and economic considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visual representation of geographic data on a map using various symbols to depict different types of features\nIt includes the choice of symbols, their sizes, colors, styles, and labels to represent different map elements like roads, rivers, cities, elevation, land use, and more\nGraphic symbols complement map scale and projections, by making visible the features, places, and other locational information represented on the map.\nMap symbols serve as a graphic code for storing and retrieving data\n\n\n\nBasic cartographical visual variables.

And the name he chose for his massive collection of maps — “Atlas” — is widely used.\nThis map was designed only for navigation, but when used incorrectly, can cause people to misudnderstand the sizes of continents and nations.\nHis new map was a revelation, because:\n\nthe projection kept the latitude and longitude lines at consistent 90 degree angles.\nmade it easier for sailors to plot their course without constantly adjusting for mapping mistakes.\nEasier to see the relationships between landmasses.\nThe downside was that it distorted the size of land masses, particularly near the poles\nThis map was designed only for navigation, but when used incorrectly, can cause people to misudnderstand the sizes of continents and nations.\n\nThat achievement was followed by the publication of Mercator’s Atlas. Though it wasn’t the first book of maps, the name Mercator chose came to define the type of book.\nIn recent years, the Mercator projection has come under fire for distorting the real shape of the world’s continents — objects closer to the poles appear larger than they should. That results in North America looking larger than Africa, or China looking smaller than Greenland, when really the opposite is true.\n\n\n\n\nGeographic Misconceptions: The distortion inherent in the Mercator projection has led to widespread misconceptions. People have the wrong idea about the relative size of countries and continents. Africa, for example, is vastly larger than Greenland in reality, yet on a Mercator map, they comparable in size. This skewed perception has implications for how people understand global geography. It can reinforce Eurocentric views of the world. Europe appears larger and more centrally located than it is in reality.\nCultural and Political Impacts: The Mercator projection has been critiqued for reinforcing colonial and imperialist worldviews. The projection enlarges Europe and North America while minimizing the Global South. This effect perpetuates a sense of dominance and importance for the countries in the Northern Hemisphere. This bias can subtly influence political and cultural attitudes. It contributes to a worldview that overemphasizes the power and significance of the North at the expense of the South.\nEducational Consequences: The Mercator projection’s prevalence in educational settings, particularly in classrooms, has had lasting impacts. These impacts affect students’ understanding of world geography. The distorted sizes of continents and countries can lead to misconceptions that persist into adulthood. These misconceptions can influence everything from personal worldviews to policy decisions. An inaccurate understanding of geography can lead to flawed strategic and economic considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visual representation of geographic data on a map using various symbols to depict different types of features\nIt includes the choice of symbols, their sizes, colors, styles, and labels to represent different map elements like roads, rivers, cities, elevation, land use, and more\nGraphic symbols complement map scale and projections, by making visible the features, places, and other locational information represented on the map.\nMap symbols serve as a graphic code for storing and retrieving data\n\n\n\nBasic cartographical visual variables.

    "text": "Principi di map design\nQuando si progetta una mappa, l’obiettivo principale e’ quello di comunicare un messaggio.\n\nche domande bisogna porsi quando si disegna una mappa?\n\nCinque di questi principi principali sono legibility, visual contrast, figure-ground, hierarchical organization, and balance (https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/design-principles-for-cartography). Quando usati in maniera appropriata, questo sistema di principi favorisce e guida la lettura di una mappa sulla pagina in maniera chiara e in grado di comunicare il messaggio che il map maker vuole comunicare.\n\nVisual Contrast\nVisual contrast relates to how map featrues and page elements contrast with each other and their background. A well-designed map with a high visual contrast can result in a crisp, cleanm sharp-looking map. The higher the contrast between features, the more something will stand out. This is ususally the feature that is darker or brighter. Conversely, a map that has low visual contrast can be used to promote a more subtle impression. Features that have less contrast will appear to belong together.\n\n\nLegibility\nLegibility is “the ability to be seen and understood”. It depends on good decision-making for selecting symbols that are familiar to the rider, and choosing appropriate sizes so that the results are effortlessy seen and easily understood (example image). Geometric symbols are easier to read at smaller sizes; more complex symbols or incons require larger amounts of space to be legible (examples).\nIn linea di principio questi aspetti sono controllabili quando la mappa e’ stampata su un foglio di carta - un media ormai passato quasi obsoleto, dal momento che la gran parte della comunicazione visiva, mappe incluse, passa attraverso altri media come schermi digitali. Nel processo di mappatura, si effettuano diverse iterazioni - prove di stampa - per rifinire il contenuto e l’aspetto di una mappa, la grandezza dei simboli e delle labels, la dimensione e posizione della legenda, l’adeguatezza della scala di rappresentazione, eccetera. L’uso di strumenti e software digitale, come gis, cad, o graphica visiva (es. senza nominare illustrator o photoshop), nella costruzione della mappa, e l’uso di schermi per la sua comunicazione, spesso fanno tralasciare questi aspetti, risultando in immagini difficilmente legibili perche’ troppo piccole, o altro.\nIn questo senso, bisogna sempre considerare il supporto finale che ospitera’ la mappa. Finira’ in un libro? Che dimensioni avra’ questo libro? Quanto spazio posso usare nella pagina? Finira’ in un articolo scientifico? Sara’ proiettata su uno schermo di grandi dimensioni o di piccole dimensioni? eccetera.\nQuesti due principi sono propedetuici to other design principles: figure-ground, hierarchical organization, and balance.\nA map is a graphic representation, drawn to scale and traditionaly on a flat surface, of features of an area of the Earth. Such features can vary, they can be geographical - for instance, landforms, rivers, or geopolitical - administrative boundaries.\nDa un punto di vista tecnico, mappare significa riportare degli elementi\n\n\nFigure-ground\nFigure-ground organization is the spontaneous separation of the figure in the foreground from an “amorphous” background. Cartographers use this design principle to help their map readers find the area of the map or page to focus on.\nThere are many to promote figure-ground organization, such as adding detail to the map or using a white wash, a drop shadow, or feathering.\n\n\nHierarchical organization\nThe internal graphic structuring of the map - and the page layout more generally - is fundamental to helping people read your map. A hierarchy is the visual separation of your map into layers of information. Some types of features will be seen as more important that other kinds of features, and some features will seem more important than other features of the same type.\novviamente, questo dipende dal tipo di mappa sui cui dovete lavorare.\nHieararchical organization on reference maps (add link) works differently than on thematic maps (add link). For reference maps, many of the features should be no more important than one another and so, visually, they should lie on essentially the same visual plane. In reference maps, hierarchy is ususally more subtle and the map reader brings elements to the forefront by focusing attention on them.\nExample: a topographic map\nFor thematic maps, the theme is more important than the base that provides geographic context.\nExample: choroplet map\n\n\nBalance\nBalance involves the organization of the map and other elements on the page. A well-balanced map page results in an impression of equilibrium and harmony.\nWe can also use balance in different ways to promote “edginess” or “tension” or create an impression that is more “organic”. Balance results from two primary factors, visual weight and visual direction.\nIf you imagine that the center of your map page is balancing on a fulcrum, the factors that will “tip” the map in a particular direction include the relative location, shape, size, and subject matter of elements on the page.",

Geoprocessing Tools &gt; Clip\nInput layer: klimaat:klimaatpanden_2022 (the climate buildings layer)\nOverlay layer: bbox_buffered\nClick Run\nThis will create a new layer containing only the climate data within your buffered study area\nYou can now remove the original (unclipped) WFS layer to improve performance\n\nExplore the layer:\n\nZoom to your study area (the Rotterdam neighbourhoods you selected)\nNotice that buildings are vector features you can select and query\nOpen the attribute table (right-click layer &gt; Open Attribute Table)\nExplore the climate adaptation attributes like water overlay risk, heat stress, and biodiversity scores\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Connecting to WMS for Background Imagery\nWhat is WMS? WMS provides access to pre-rendered map images - like a background map. You cannot query individual features, but it loads faster for large areas.\n\nOpen the Data Source Manager again (Ctrl+L)\nSelect the WMS / WMTS tab on the left\nCreate a new WMS connection:\n\nClick New to create a new connection\nName: PDOK Aerial Photos\nURL: https://service.pdok.nl/hwh/luchtfotorgb/wms/v1_0\nClick OK\n\nLoad a WMS layer:\n\nSelect the “PDOK Aerial Photos” connection and click Connect\nSelect Actueel_orthoHR (current high-resolution aerial photos)\nClick Add\nClick Close\n\nArrange your layers:\n\nIn the Layers panel, drag layers so the order from top to bottom is:\n\nbuurten (neighbourhood boundaries)\nClipped climate buildings layer\nbbox_buffered (buffer outline)\nActueel_orthoHR (aerial photos - at the bottom)\n\nAdjust the transparency of the buildings layer if needed (Right-click &gt; Properties &gt; Symbology &gt; Layer Rendering &gt; adjust opacity slider)\nStyle the neighbourhood boundaries with a bold outline and no fill to see the aerial photo underneath"

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this exercise, you will learn how to connect to external geospatial data sources using QGIS’s Data Source Manager. You’ll work with real Dutch open data, combining different data layers to create a focused analysis area around Rotterdam neighbourhoods.\nYou will retrieve neighbourhood boundaries via WFS, perform spatial operations to create a study area, and then use this area to clip climate adaptation data. Finally, you’ll add aerial imagery via WMS to visualize your results.\nThis workflow demonstrates a common GIS task: defining a study area, retrieving relevant data, and preparing it for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WFS?\n\n\n\nWFS (Web Feature Service) provides access to vector data (points, lines, polygons) that you can query, style, analyze, and edit in QGIS. Think of it as downloading the actual geographic features with all their attributes. WFS is ideal when you need to perform spatial analysis or select specific features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WMS?\n\n\n\nWMS (Web Map Service) provides access to pre-rendered map images - essentially picture tiles of maps. You cannot query individual features or access attributes, but WMS layers load quickly and are perfect for background/reference maps. Think of it as viewing a map image rather than working with the data itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Differences Between WFS and WMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nWFS\nWMS\n\n\n\n\nData type\nVector (features)\nRaster (images)\n\n\nFile size\nCan be large\nSmaller\n\n\nQueryable\nYes\nNo\n\n\nStylable in QGIS\nYes\nLimited\n\n\nEditable\nYes\nNo\n\n\nBest for\nAnalysis, editing, selection\nBackground maps, visualization"
