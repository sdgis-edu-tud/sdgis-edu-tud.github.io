    "text": "Scale is the relationship between a distance on a map and the corresponding distance on the ground.\nIt affects the level of detail that can be shown and the map’s overall purpose.\nIt affects generalization: as scale decreases (i.e., becomes smaller), map makers must generalize features. This means they simplify, aggregate, or omit certain details to keep the map legible and useful.\nWhile scales in GIS are exactly defined and represented on the map as s scale bar or ratio, general discussions about map scale often use the relative terms: large scale, medium scale, and small scale.\n\n\nIn spatial design disciplines, we offer associate the terms “small” and “large” in relation to the portion of territory that maps frame. A small scale map indicates a “zoom-in” area,\nIn Cartographic terms, Large-scale maps show things as big and small-scsale maps show things as small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscales\n\n\n\n\nSmall scale: 1:250,000 and smaller\nMedium scale: 1:50,000 to 1:250,000\nLarge scale: 1:50,000 and larger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial data are produced with a scale. An example is the dataset from Natural Earth1\n\n\n\n\nit is hard to represent our spherical world on a flat piece of paper. That is why cartographers use projections: to morph the globe into 2D map.\nProjection is a method of transforming the three-dimensional surface of the Earth into a two-dimensional map.\nBecause a curved surface cannot be flattened without distortion, every projection results in some form of distortion. The type and extend of this distortion depend on the projection method used.\nThese pictures from 1921 compare how the drwaing of a man’s head changes in different projections, resulting in different distoritions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe True Size of allows you to understand how distortion affects shapes proportions. You can drag and drop countries’ shapes around the map and explore the effect that distortion does.\nCountries more in the north, such as Russia or Canada, or to the sout, such argentina and australia, are depicted way bigger than they are in the Mercator Projection. Similarly, countries lying on the equator look smaller.\nQuesto significa che ogni mappa, seppur geometricamente e matematicamente inecceplibile, non puo’ non produrre distorsioni che affect la reppresentazione di geographical fitures sul nostro pianeta quando proiettate su una mappa piatta.\nQuesto tipo di rappresentazione affect anche il modo in cui noi percepiamo il mondo, attraverso la nostra mappa mentale. Per questo motivo la mappa di mercatore e’ stata molto criticata\nOn the Mercator projection, greenland appears to be roughly the same size as Africa. In reality, Greenland is 0.8 million sq. miles, and Africa is 11.6 million sq. miles, nearly 14 and a half times larger.\nGerardus Mercator revolutionized map making2. His Mercator projection map, invented in 1569, was the primary map that navigators used for years. It’s the form that many maps still come in today. And the name he chose for his massive collection of maps — “Atlas” — is widely used.\nThis map was designed only for navigation, but when used incorrectly, can cause people to misudnderstand the sizes of continents and nations.\nHis new map was a revelation, because:\n\nthe projection kept the latitude and longitude lines at consistent 90 degree angles.\nmade it easier for sailors to plot their course without constantly adjusting for mapping mistakes.\nEasier to see the relationships between landmasses.\nThe downside was that it distorted the size of land masses, particularly near the poles\nThis map was designed only for navigation, but when used incorrectly, can cause people to misudnderstand the sizes of continents and nations.\n\nThat achievement was followed by the publication of Mercator’s Atlas. Though it wasn’t the first book of maps, the name Mercator chose came to define the type of book.\nIn recent years, the Mercator projection has come under fire for distorting the real shape of the world’s continents — objects closer to the poles appear larger than they should. That results in North America looking larger than Africa, or China looking smaller than Greenland, when really the opposite is true.\n\n\n\n\nGeographic Misconceptions: The distortion inherent in the Mercator projection has led to widespread misconceptions. People have the wrong idea about the relative size of countries and continents. Africa, for example, is vastly larger than Greenland in reality, yet on a Mercator map, they comparable in size. This skewed perception has implications for how people understand global geography. It can reinforce Eurocentric views of the world. Europe appears larger and more centrally located than it is in reality.\nCultural and Political Impacts: The Mercator projection has been critiqued for reinforcing colonial and imperialist worldviews. The projection enlarges Europe and North America while minimizing the Global South. This effect perpetuates a sense of dominance and importance for the countries in the Northern Hemisphere. This bias can subtly influence political and cultural attitudes. It contributes to a worldview that overemphasizes the power and significance of the North at the expense of the South.\nEducational Consequences: The Mercator projection’s prevalence in educational settings, particularly in classrooms, has had lasting impacts. These impacts affect students’ understanding of world geography. The distorted sizes of continents and countries can lead to misconceptions that persist into adulthood. These misconceptions can influence everything from personal worldviews to policy decisions. An inaccurate understanding of geography can lead to flawed strategic and economic considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visual representation of geographic data on a map using various symbols to depict different types of features\nIt includes the choice of symbols, their sizes, colors, styles, and labels to represent different map elements like roads, rivers, cities, elevation, land use, and more\nGraphic symbols complement map scale and projections, by making visible the features, places, and other locational information represented on the map.\nMap symbols serve as a graphic code for storing and retrieving data\n\n\n\nBasic cartographical visual variables.

This means they simplify, aggregate, or omit certain details to keep the map legible and useful.\nWhile scales in GIS are exactly defined and represented on the map as s scale bar or ratio, general discussions about map scale often use the relative terms: large scale, medium scale, and small scale.\n\n\nIn spatial design disciplines, we offer associate the terms “small” and “large” in relation to the portion of territory that maps frame. A small scale map indicates a “zoom-in” area,\nIn Cartographic terms, Large-scale maps show things as big and small-scsale maps show things as small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscales\n\n\n\n\nSmall scale: 1:250,000 and smaller\nMedium scale: 1:50,000 to 1:250,000\nLarge scale: 1:50,000 and larger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial data are produced with a scale. An example is the dataset from Natural Earth1\n\n\n\n\nit is hard to represent our spherical world on a flat piece of paper. That is why cartographers use projections: to morph the globe into 2D map.\nProjection is a method of transforming the three-dimensional surface of the Earth into a two-dimensional map.\nBecause a curved surface cannot be flattened without distortion, every projection results in some form of distortion. The type and extend of this distortion depend on the projection method used.\nThese pictures from 1921 compare how the drwaing of a man’s head changes in different projections, resulting in different distoritions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe True Size of allows you to understand how distortion affects shapes proportions. You can drag and drop countries’ shapes around the map and explore the effect that distortion does.\nCountries more in the north, such as Russia or Canada, or to the sout, such argentina and australia, are depicted way bigger than they are in the Mercator Projection. Similarly, countries lying on the equator look smaller.\nQuesto significa che ogni mappa, seppur geometricamente e matematicamente inecceplibile, non puo’ non produrre distorsioni che affect la reppresentazione di geographical fitures sul nostro pianeta quando proiettate su una mappa piatta.\nQuesto tipo di rappresentazione affect anche il modo in cui noi percepiamo il mondo, attraverso la nostra mappa mentale. Per questo motivo la mappa di mercatore e’ stata molto criticata\nOn the Mercator projection, greenland appears to be roughly the same size as Africa. In reality, Greenland is 0.8 million sq. miles, and Africa is 11.6 million sq. miles, nearly 14 and a half times larger.\nGerardus Mercator revolutionized map making2. His Mercator projection map, invented in 1569, was the primary map that navigators used for years. It’s the form that many maps still come in today. And the name he chose for his massive collection of maps — “Atlas” — is widely used.\nThis map was designed only for navigation, but when used incorrectly, can cause people to misudnderstand the sizes of continents and nations.\nHis new map was a revelation, because:\n\nthe projection kept the latitude and longitude lines at consistent 90 degree angles.\nmade it easier for sailors to plot their course without constantly adjusting for mapping mistakes.\nEasier to see the relationships between landmasses.\nThe downside was that it distorted the size of land masses, particularly near the poles\nThis map was designed only for navigation, but when used incorrectly, can cause people to misudnderstand the sizes of continents and nations.\n\nThat achievement was followed by the publication of Mercator’s Atlas. Though it wasn’t the first book of maps, the name Mercator chose came to define the type of book.\nIn recent years, the Mercator projection has come under fire for distorting the real shape of the world’s continents — objects closer to the poles appear larger than they should. That results in North America looking larger than Africa, or China looking smaller than Greenland, when really the opposite is true.\n\n\n\n\nGeographic Misconceptions: The distortion inherent in the Mercator projection has led to widespread misconceptions. People have the wrong idea about the relative size of countries and continents. Africa, for example, is vastly larger than Greenland in reality, yet on a Mercator map, they comparable in size. This skewed perception has implications for how people understand global geography. It can reinforce Eurocentric views of the world. Europe appears larger and more centrally located than it is in reality.\nCultural and Political Impacts: The Mercator projection has been critiqued for reinforcing colonial and imperialist worldviews. The projection enlarges Europe and North America while minimizing the Global South. This effect perpetuates a sense of dominance and importance for the countries in the Northern Hemisphere. This bias can subtly influence political and cultural attitudes. It contributes to a worldview that overemphasizes the power and significance of the North at the expense of the South.\nEducational Consequences: The Mercator projection’s prevalence in educational settings, particularly in classrooms, has had lasting impacts. These impacts affect students’ understanding of world geography. The distorted sizes of continents and countries can lead to misconceptions that persist into adulthood. These misconceptions can influence everything from personal worldviews to policy decisions. An inaccurate understanding of geography can lead to flawed strategic and economic considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visual representation of geographic data on a map using various symbols to depict different types of features\nIt includes the choice of symbols, their sizes, colors, styles, and labels to represent different map elements like roads, rivers, cities, elevation, land use, and more\nGraphic symbols complement map scale and projections, by making visible the features, places, and other locational information represented on the map.\nMap symbols serve as a graphic code for storing and retrieving data\n\n\n\nBasic cartographical visual variables.

    "text": "Principi di map design\nQuando si progetta una mappa, l’obiettivo principale e’ quello di comunicare un messaggio.\n\nche domande bisogna porsi quando si disegna una mappa?\n\nCinque di questi principi principali sono legibility, visual contrast, figure-ground, hierarchical organization, and balance (https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/design-principles-for-cartography). Quando usati in maniera appropriata, questo sistema di principi favorisce e guida la lettura di una mappa sulla pagina in maniera chiara e in grado di comunicare il messaggio che il map maker vuole comunicare.\n\nVisual Contrast\nVisual contrast relates to how map featrues and page elements contrast with each other and their background. A well-designed map with a high visual contrast can result in a crisp, cleanm sharp-looking map. The higher the contrast between features, the more something will stand out. This is ususally the feature that is darker or brighter. Conversely, a map that has low visual contrast can be used to promote a more subtle impression. Features that have less contrast will appear to belong together.\n\n\nLegibility\nLegibility is “the ability to be seen and understood”. It depends on good decision-making for selecting symbols that are familiar to the rider, and choosing appropriate sizes so that the results are effortlessy seen and easily understood (example image). Geometric symbols are easier to read at smaller sizes; more complex symbols or incons require larger amounts of space to be legible (examples).\nIn linea di principio questi aspetti sono controllabili quando la mappa e’ stampata su un foglio di carta - un media ormai passato quasi obsoleto, dal momento che la gran parte della comunicazione visiva, mappe incluse, passa attraverso altri media come schermi digitali. Nel processo di mappatura, si effettuano diverse iterazioni - prove di stampa - per rifinire il contenuto e l’aspetto di una mappa, la grandezza dei simboli e delle labels, la dimensione e posizione della legenda, l’adeguatezza della scala di rappresentazione, eccetera. L’uso di strumenti e software digitale, come gis, cad, o graphica visiva (es. senza nominare illustrator o photoshop), nella costruzione della mappa, e l’uso di schermi per la sua comunicazione, spesso fanno tralasciare questi aspetti, risultando in immagini difficilmente legibili perche’ troppo piccole, o altro.\nIn questo senso, bisogna sempre considerare il supporto finale che ospitera’ la mappa. Finira’ in un libro? Che dimensioni avra’ questo libro? Quanto spazio posso usare nella pagina? Finira’ in un articolo scientifico? Sara’ proiettata su uno schermo di grandi dimensioni o di piccole dimensioni? eccetera.\nQuesti due principi sono propedetuici to other design principles: figure-ground, hierarchical organization, and balance.\nA map is a graphic representation, drawn to scale and traditionaly on a flat surface, of features of an area of the Earth. Such features can vary, they can be geographical - for instance, landforms, rivers, or geopolitical - administrative boundaries.\nDa un punto di vista tecnico, mappare significa riportare degli elementi\n\n\nFigure-ground\nFigure-ground organization is the spontaneous separation of the figure in the foreground from an “amorphous” background. Cartographers use this design principle to help their map readers find the area of the map or page to focus on.\nThere are many to promote figure-ground organization, such as adding detail to the map or using a white wash, a drop shadow, or feathering.\n\n\nHierarchical organization\nThe internal graphic structuring of the map - and the page layout more generally - is fundamental to helping people read your map. A hierarchy is the visual separation of your map into layers of information. Some types of features will be seen as more important that other kinds of features, and some features will seem more important than other features of the same type.\novviamente, questo dipende dal tipo di mappa sui cui dovete lavorare.\nHieararchical organization on reference maps (add link) works differently than on thematic maps (add link). For reference maps, many of the features should be no more important than one another and so, visually, they should lie on essentially the same visual plane. In reference maps, hierarchy is ususally more subtle and the map reader brings elements to the forefront by focusing attention on them.\nExample: a topographic map\nFor thematic maps, the theme is more important than the base that provides geographic context.\nExample: choroplet map\n\n\nBalance\nBalance involves the organization of the map and other elements on the page. A well-balanced map page results in an impression of equilibrium and harmony.\nWe can also use balance in different ways to promote “edginess” or “tension” or create an impression that is more “organic”. Balance results from two primary factors, visual weight and visual direction.\nIf you imagine that the center of your map page is balancing on a fulcrum, the factors that will “tip” the map in a particular direction include the relative location, shape, size, and subject matter of elements on the page.",

You’ll work with real Dutch open data, combining different data layers to create a focused analysis area around Rotterdam neighbourhoods.\nYou will retrieve neighbourhood boundaries via WFS, perform spatial operations to create a study area, and then use this area to clip climate adaptation data. Finally, you’ll add aerial imagery via WMS to visualize your results.\nThis workflow demonstrates a common GIS task: defining a study area, retrieving relevant data, and preparing it for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WFS?\n\n\n\nWFS (Web Feature Service) provides access to vector data (points, lines, polygons) that you can query, style, analyze, and edit in QGIS. Think of it as downloading the actual geographic features with all their attributes. WFS is ideal when you need to perform spatial analysis or select specific features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WMS?\n\n\n\nWMS (Web Map Service) provides access to pre-rendered map images - essentially picture tiles of maps. You cannot query individual features or access attributes, but WMS layers load quickly and are perfect for background/reference maps. Think of it as viewing a map image rather than working with the data itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Differences Between WFS and WMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nWFS\nWMS\n\n\n\n\nData type\nVector (features)\nRaster (images)\n\n\nFile size\nCan be large\nSmaller\n\n\nQueryable\nYes\nNo\n\n\nStylable in QGIS\nYes\nLimited\n\n\nEditable\nYes\nNo\n\n\nBest for\nAnalysis, editing, selection\nBackground maps, visualization"

    "text": "Introduction\nGeoreferencing is the process of assigning real-world coordinates to a scanned map, aerial photo, or any image that doesn’t have spatial reference information. This is essential when working with historical maps, old plans, paper maps, or any non-digital cartographic material.\nDigitizing is the process of tracing features from a georeferenced image to create vector data (points, lines, or polygons). This allows you to extract information from maps and make it usable for spatial analysis.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll georeference a historical map of part of Rotterdam and digitize features from it, comparing them with current aerial imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Georeferencing?\n\n\n\nGeoreferencing links the pixels of a raster image to real-world geographic coordinates. You do this by identifying Ground Control Points (GCPs) - locations that you can identify both on your unreferenced image and on a georeferenced map or layer. QGIS then uses these points to calculate a mathematical transformation that warps your image to fit the coordinate system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Transformations\n\n\n\n\nLinear: Requires 3+ points. Simple scaling, rotation, and translation. Good for maps that are already fairly accurate.\nHelmert: Requires 2+ points. Preserves angles and scale uniformity. Good for scanned maps.\nPolynomial (1st, 2nd, 3rd order): Requires increasing numbers of points (6, 10, 15+). Can handle more complex distortions. Higher orders can introduce warping artifacts.\nThin Plate Spline (TPS): Requires 10+ points. Flexible local warping. Good for maps with local distortions.\n\nFor most historical maps, Polynomial 1st or 2nd order works well."

    "text": "Introduction\nGeoreferencing is the process of assigning real-world coordinates to a scanned map, aerial photo, or any image that doesn’t have spatial reference information. This is essential when working with historical maps, old plans, paper maps, or any non-digital cartographic material.\nDigitizing is the process of tracing features from a georeferenced image to create vector data (points, lines, or polygons). This allows you to extract information from maps and make it usable for spatial analysis.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll georeference a historical map of part of Rotterdam and digitize features from it, comparing them with current aerial imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Georeferencing?\n\n\n\nGeoreferencing links the pixels of a raster image to real-world geographic coordinates. You do this by identifying Ground Control Points (GCPs) - locations that you can identify both on your unreferenced image and on a georeferenced map or layer. QGIS then uses these points to calculate a mathematical transformation that warps your image to fit the coordinate system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Transformations\n\n\n\n\nLinear: Requires 3+ points. Simple scaling, rotation, and translation. Good for maps that are already fairly accurate.\nHelmert: Requires 2+ points. Preserves angles and scale uniformity. Good for scanned maps.\nPolynomial (1st, 2nd, 3rd order): Requires increasing numbers of points (6, 10, 15+). Can handle more complex distortions. Higher orders can introduce warping artifacts.\nThin Plate Spline (TPS): Requires 10+ points. Flexible local warping. Good for maps with local distortions.\n\nFor most historical maps, Polynomial 1st or 2nd order works well."

Errors under 2 meters are excellent. If you see errors above 10 meters, review your GCPs.\n\n\nApply the georeferencing:\n\nClick Export Raster or Apply (depending on plugin version)\nChoose output settings:\n\nOutput file: Save as print_georeferenced.tif in your working folder\nCRS: EPSG:28992\nResampling: Lanczos or Cubic\n\nClick OK\nThe georeferenced raster will be added to your map\n\nVerify the result:\n\nToggle the georeferenced layer on/off to compare with the aerial photo\nCheck different areas of the image\nIf alignment is poor, you may need to add more GCPs or adjust existing ones\nYou can save the GCP points for future reference: File &gt; Save GCP Points As...\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Final georeferenced map overlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 4: Digitizing Features from the Georeferenced Map\nNow that your map is georeferenced, you can extract information by digitizing vector features.\n\nCreate a new vector layer for digitizing:\nExample: Digitizing buildings\n\nGo to Layer &gt; Create Layer &gt; New GeoPackage Layer...\nDatabase: Click ... and save as digitized_features.gpkg\nLayer name: buildings_historical\nGeometry type: Polygon\nCRS: EPSG:28992\n\nAdd attribute fields:\n\nClick New Field to add attributes:\n\nName: building_id | Type: Whole number (Integer)\nName: building_type | Type: Text data | Length: 50\nName: notes | Type: Text data | Length: 100\n\nClick OK to create the layer\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Creating a new vector layer for digitizing\n\n\nStart digitizing:\n\nSelect the buildings_historical layer in the Layers panel\nClick the Toggle Editing button (pencil icon) or press Ctrl+E\nClick the Add Polygon Feature button (or press Ctrl+.)\n\nDigitizing workflow:\n\nLeft-click to place vertices around the building outline\nRight-click to finish the polygon\nEnter attribute values in the pop-up form:\n\nbuilding_id: 1, 2, 3, etc.\nbuilding_type: e.g., “residential”, “church”, “warehouse”\nnotes: any observations\n\nClick OK\n\nDigitizing tips:\n\nZoom in close for precision\nUse the mouse wheel to zoom in/out while digitizing\nPress Backspace to remove the last vertex\nPress Esc to cancel the current feature\nEnable snapping (Settings &gt; Snapping Options) to connect features precisely\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Digitizing building polygons\n\n\nDigitize multiple features:\n\nDigitize at least 5-10 buildings from your georeferenced map\nTry to choose buildings of different types or sizes\nMake sure each feature has complete attributes\n\nEdit existing features (if needed):\n\nWith editing enabled, select the Vertex Tool (or press V)\nClick on a feature to see its vertices\nClick and drag vertices to adjust position\nClick between vertices to add new ones\nClick on a vertex and press Delete to remove it\n\nSave your edits:\n\nClick the Save Layer Edits button (floppy disk icon)\nClick Toggle Editing again to stop editing\nYour digitized features are now permanently saved in the GeoPackage\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 - Completed digitized buildings\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 5: Analysis and Comparison (Optional)\n\nCompare historical vs. current:\n\nStyle your digitized historical buildings with a semi-transparent fill (e.g., red, 50% opacity)\nToggle between the georeferenced map and current aerial photo\nIdentify buildings that:\n\nStill exist in the same form\nHave been demolished\nHave changed in size or shape\n\n\nCreate additional layers:\nYou can create separate layers for different feature types:\n\nLines: Roads, canals, railways\nPoints: Trees, monuments, street furniture\nPolygons: Parks, building footprints, land use areas\n\nFollow the same process as steps 16-20, adjusting the geometry type as needed."

While QGIS has built-in charting capabilities, specialized visualization tools like RAWGraphs offer: - More chart types and customization options - Interactive, web-friendly outputs - Better design for presentations and reports - Easier sharing with non-GIS users\nThis tutorial demonstrates interoperability - the ability to move data between different software tools to leverage their respective strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is RAWGraphs?\n\n\n\nRAWGraphs 2.0 is a free, open-source web application for creating custom vector-based visualizations.

Save Features As...\nFormat: Comma Separated Value [CSV]\nFile name: Click ... and save as rotterdam_climate_stats.csv\nCRS: You can leave as-is (won’t matter for CSV without geometry)\nLayer Options:\n\nGeometry: Select AS_WKT if you want to keep geometry, or No geometry for pure tabular data\nFor visualization purposes, choose No geometry\n\nSelect fields to export:\n\nUncheck any fields you don’t need\nKeep: neighbourhood name, building count, average scores, totals\n\nClick OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSV Export Tips\n\n\n\n\nRemove geometry for cleaner data visualization (unless you need it)\nRemove unnecessary fields to reduce file size and complexity\nUse meaningful field names - rename fields if needed before export\nCheck for special characters in text fields that might cause issues\nVerify decimal separators match your regional settings\n\n\n\nVerify your CSV export:\n\nOpen the CSV file in a text editor or spreadsheet program\nCheck that:\n\nHeaders are present and clear\nData is properly separated by commas\nNo corrupted or missing values\nNumeric values use decimal points (not commas, if that’s your locale)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Exported CSV file preview\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 5: Creating Visualizations in RAWGraphs 2.0\n\nOpen RAWGraphs:\n\nOpen your web browser\nNavigate to: https://app.rawgraphs.io/\nYou’ll see a clean interface with three main steps: Load data → Choose a chart → Customize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Note\n\n\n\nRAWGraphs runs entirely in your browser. Your data is NOT uploaded to any server - it stays on your computer. This makes it safe for working with sensitive data.\n\n\nLoad your data into RAWGraphs:\n\nIn the “Load your data” section, you have several options:\n\nUpload a file: Click and select your rotterdam_climate_stats.csv\nCopy/paste: Open the CSV in a text editor, copy all content, and paste it\nURL: If your data is online (not applicable here)\n\nAfter loading, RAWGraphs will automatically detect your columns\nYou should see a data preview table at the bottom\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 - RAWGraphs data loading interface\n\n\nChoose a chart type:\nRAWGraphs offers many chart types. Here are some good options for our climate data:\nFor comparing neighbourhoods:\n\nBar chart - Simple comparison of values across neighbourhoods\nCircular dendrogram - Hierarchical comparison\nBump chart - Ranking changes (if you have time-series data)\n\nFor showing distributions:\n\nBox plot - Show data distribution and outliers\nViolin plot - Distribution shape across categories\n\nFor showing proportions:\n\nTreemap - Hierarchical proportional areas\nCircle packing - Nested proportional circles\nSunburst - Radial hierarchical diagram\n\nFor relationships:\n\nScatter plot - Correlation between two variables\nAlluvial diagram - Flow between categories\n\nLet’s start with a Bar chart:\n\nScroll through the chart options\nClick on Bar chart\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9 - RAWGraphs chart type selection\n\n\nMap your data to visual variables:\nFor a bar chart showing average climate risk by neighbourhood:\n\nX axis: Drag your neighbourhood name field here\nY axis: Drag avg_climate_risk (or your chosen metric) here\nColor: (optional) Drag risk_category or another categorical field to color bars\nSeries: Leave empty for now\n\nYou should immediately see a preview of your chart below\nCustomize your visualization:\nRAWGraphs provides many customization options:\nLayout:\n\nWidth & Height: Adjust canvas size\nMargins: Adjust spacing around the chart\nSort by: Choose how to order bars (alphabetical, by value ascending/descending)\n\nAxes:\n\nShow axis labels: Enable/disable\nAxis title: Customize text\nGrid: Show/hide grid lines\n\nColors:\n\nColor scheme: Choose from predefined palettes or create custom colors\nClick on color swatches to change individual colors\n\nLabels:\n\nShow values: Display numbers on bars\nFont size: Adjust text size\n\nExperiment with these settings until you’re happy with the result\n\n\n\nFigure 10 - RAWGraphs customization options\n\n\nExport your visualization:\nRAWGraphs offers multiple export formats:\n\nSVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Best for further editing in design software (Illustrator, Inkscape)\nPNG: Raster image, good for presentations and documents\nJSON: Save your chart configuration to reload later\n\nTo export:\n\nScroll down to the “Export” section\nChoose your format (SVG recommended for quality)\nClick Download button\nSave the file to your working folder\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 - Exported bar chart\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 6: Creating Additional Visualizations\n\nCreate a Treemap to show building area distribution:\n\nClick Back or refresh RAWGraphs to start over\nLoad the same CSV data\nChoose Treemap chart type\nHierarchy: Drag neighbourhood name field\nSize: Drag total_building_area\nColor: Drag avg_climate_risk to color by risk level\nLabel: Drag neighbourhood name\nCustomize:\n\nChoose a diverging color scheme (e.g., blue to red)\nAdjust padding between rectangles\nEnable/disable labels based on readability\n\nExport your treemap\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12 - Treemap showing building areas\n\n\nCreate a Scatter plot to explore relationships:\nIf you have multiple numeric variables, explore their relationships:\n\nStart a new chart in RAWGraphs\nChoose Scatter plot\nX axis: Drag avg_building_area\nY axis: Drag avg_climate_risk\nSize: (optional) Drag building_count to size points by number of buildings\nColor: (optional) Drag risk_category\nLabel: Drag neighbourhood name to label points\nCustomize and export\n\nThis chart helps identify if there’s a relationship between building size and climate risk\n\n\n\nFigure 13 - Scatter plot exploring variable relationships\n\n\nCreate a Box plot to show data distribution:\nBox plots are excellent for comparing distributions across categories:\n\nStart a new chart\nChoose Box plot\nGroups: Drag risk_category (Low/Medium/High Risk)\nValues: Drag a numeric field (e.g., building_area)\nThis shows how building sizes are distributed across different risk categories\nCustomize and export\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14 - Box plot showing distributions"
