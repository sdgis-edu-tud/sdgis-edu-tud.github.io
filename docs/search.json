    "text": "Introduction\nIn this exercise, you will learn how to connect to external geospatial data sources using QGIS’s Data Source Manager. You’ll work with real Dutch open data, combining different data layers to create a focused analysis area around Rotterdam neighbourhoods.\nYou will retrieve neighbourhood boundaries via WFS, perform spatial operations to create a study area, and then use this area to clip climate adaptation data. Finally, you’ll add aerial imagery via WMS to visualize your results.\nThis workflow demonstrates a common GIS task: defining a study area, retrieving relevant data, and preparing it for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WFS?\n\n\n\nWFS (Web Feature Service) provides access to vector data (points, lines, polygons) that you can query, style, analyze, and edit in QGIS. Think of it as downloading the actual geographic features with all their attributes. WFS is ideal when you need to perform spatial analysis or select specific features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WMS?\n\n\n\nWMS (Web Map Service) provides access to pre-rendered map images - essentially picture tiles of maps. You cannot query individual features or access attributes, but WMS layers load quickly and are perfect for background/reference maps. Think of it as viewing a map image rather than working with the data itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Differences Between WFS and WMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nWFS\nWMS\n\n\n\n\nData type\nVector (features)\nRaster (images)\n\n\nFile size\nCan be large\nSmaller\n\n\nQueryable\nYes\nNo\n\n\nStylable in QGIS\nYes\nLimited\n\n\nEditable\nYes\nNo\n\n\nBest for\nAnalysis, editing, selection\nBackground maps, visualization"

    "text": "Introduction\nGeoreferencing is the process of assigning real-world coordinates to a scanned map, aerial photo, or any image that doesn’t have spatial reference information. This is essential when working with historical maps, old plans, paper maps, or any non-digital cartographic material.\nDigitizing is the process of tracing features from a georeferenced image to create vector data (points, lines, or polygons). This allows you to extract information from maps and make it usable for spatial analysis.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll georeference a historical map of part of Rotterdam and digitize features from it, comparing them with current aerial imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Georeferencing?\n\n\n\nGeoreferencing links the pixels of a raster image to real-world geographic coordinates. You do this by identifying Ground Control Points (GCPs) - locations that you can identify both on your unreferenced image and on a georeferenced map or layer. QGIS then uses these points to calculate a mathematical transformation that warps your image to fit the coordinate system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Transformations\n\n\n\n\nLinear: Requires 3+ points. Simple scaling, rotation, and translation. Good for maps that are already fairly accurate.\nHelmert: Requires 2+ points. Preserves angles and scale uniformity. Good for scanned maps.\nPolynomial (1st, 2nd, 3rd order): Requires increasing numbers of points (6, 10, 15+). Can handle more complex distortions. Higher orders can introduce warping artifacts.\nThin Plate Spline (TPS): Requires 10+ points. Flexible local warping. Good for maps with local distortions.\n\nFor most historical maps, Polynomial 1st or 2nd order works well."

This tool allows you to combine move, rotate, and uniform scale to georeference using 2 points that are identified in both the background layers and the raster to georeference. ::: callout-note How the 2-Point Tool Works\nPoint 1: Moves the entire raster to align this point Point 2: Rotates and scales the raster around point 1 to align this second point This is sufficient for maps that don’t have complex distortions :::\nSteps:\nIn the Freehand Raster Georeferencer toolbar, click the “Georeference raster with 2 Points” tool icon First point:\nClick on a distinctive feature on your print.jpg image (e.g., a sharp building corner) Drag it to the exact same location on the reference data (aerial photo/map) The raster will move with your cursor, just like the Move tool The selected point will stay highlighted in red\nSecond point:\nClick on another distinctive feature on your print.jpg image Drag it to the corresponding location on the reference data This time, the raster will rotate and scale instead of moving The image will adjust to align both points simultaneously\nBest practices for selecting the 2 points:\nDistribute points evenly - Choose points at opposite corners or edges of the image (not close together) Maximum distance - The farther apart your points are, the more accurate the rotation and scale Choose sharp, precise features: building corners, road intersections, bridge endpoints Avoid features that may have changed over time (temporary structures, vegetation) Use features that are clearly visible in both the historical map and current reference data\nGood point locations:\n✓ Building corners (if buildings still exist in the same location) ✓ Road intersections (especially T-junctions or crossroads) ✓ Bridge corners or endpoints ✓ Monument centers or distinctive landmarks ✓ Canal locks, church spires, or other permanent structures ✗ Trees or vegetation (changes over time) ✗ Shorelines (may have changed due to development) ✗ Vague or unclear features ✗ Features that are too close together\nShow Image Refine the georeferencing if needed:\nAfter applying the 2-point tool, toggle the georeferenced layer on/off Check alignment at different locations across the map If certain areas don’t align well:\nYou can repeat the 2-point process with different points Try selecting points in areas that previously didn’t align well For maps with complex distortions, you might need to use QGIS’s built-in Georeferencer tool with more points (see Extension Activities)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen 2 Points Isn’t Enough The 2-point method works well for:\nModern, accurately printed maps Maps without significant distortion Small-scale maps or portions of larger maps\nIf your map has:\nLocal distortions or warping Non-uniform scale across the image Poor printing quality with irregular stretching\nThen consider using QGIS’s built-in Georeferencer tool which allows multiple control points and polynomial transformations.\n\n\n\nApply the georeferencing:\n\nClick the Export Raster with world file button\nChoose output settings:\n\nOutput file: Save as map_georeferenced.tif in your working folder\n\nClick OK\nThe georeferenced raster will be added to your map\n\nVerify the result:\n\nToggle the georeferenced layer on/off to compare with the aerial photo\nCheck different areas of the image, especially:\n\n-   The corners and edges (farthest from your control points)\n\n-   Major landmarks and intersections\n\n-   The black boundary outline\n\nZoom to different scales to verify alignment accuracy\nIf alignment is poor in certain areas, note where the discrepancies occur\n\nQuality check questions:\n\nDo buildings align with their current locations?\nDo roads and intersections match?\nAre the colored protection zone outlines clearly visible?\nIs the scale roughly correct across the entire map?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Final georeferenced map overlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 4: Digitizing Features from the Georeferenced Map\nNow that your map is georeferenced, you can extract information by digitizing vector features.\n\nCreate a new vector layer for digitizing:\nExample: Digitizing buildings\n\nGo to Layer &gt; Create Layer &gt; New GeoPackage Layer...\nDatabase: Click ... and save as digitized_features.gpkg\nLayer name: housing_dev_protection_zone\nGeometry type: Polygon\nCRS: EPSG:28992\n\nAdd attribute fields:\n\nClick New Field to add attributes:\n\nName: area_id | Type: Whole number (Integer)\nName: area_type | Type: Text data | Length: 50\nName: notes | Type: Text data | Length: 100\n\nClick OK to create the layer\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Creating a new vector layer for digitizing\n\n\nIdentify the three perimeters to digitize:\n\nThe georeferenced map shows “Woningbouwontwikkelingen in beschermingszone: rekening houden met profiel waterkering” (Housing Development in Protection Zone: Taking into Account Water Defense Profile). Before you start digitizing, carefully examine the georeferenced map:\n\nZoom to the area within the thick black boundary\nLook for the three polygons with the purple outline\n\n\nStart digitizing:\n\nSelect the housing_dev_protection_zonelayer in the Layers panel\nClick the Toggle Editing button (pencil icon) or press Ctrl+E\nClick the Add Polygon Feature button (or press Ctrl+.)\n\nDigitizing workflow:\n\nLeft-click to place vertices around the building outline\nRight-click to finish the polygon\nEnter attribute values in the pop-up form:\n\narea_id: 1, 2, 3, etc.\narea_type: e.g., “housing development\nnotes: any observations\n\nClick OK\n\nDigitizing tips:\n\nZoom in close for precision\nUse the mouse wheel to zoom in/out while digitizing\nPress Backspace to remove the last vertex\nPress Esc to cancel the current feature\nEnable snapping (Settings &gt; Snapping Options) to connect features precisely\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Digitizing building polygons\n\n\nDigitize multiple features:\n\nDigitize the 3 areas from your georeferenced map\nMake sure each feature has complete attributes\n\nEdit existing features (if needed):\n\nWith editing enabled, select the Vertex Tool (or press V)\nClick on a feature to see its vertices\nClick and drag vertices to adjust position\nClick between vertices to add new ones\nClick on a vertex and press Delete to remove it\n\nSave your edits:\n\nClick the Save Layer Edits button (floppy disk icon)\nClick Toggle Editing again to stop editing\nYour digitized features are now permanently saved in the GeoPackage\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 - Completed digitized buildings\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 5: Analysis and Comparison (Optional)\n\nCreate additional layers:\nYou can create separate layers for different feature types:\n\nLines: Roads, canals, railways\nPoints: Trees, monuments, street furniture\nPolygons: Parks, building footprints, land use areas\n\nFollow the same process as steps 16-20, adjusting the geometry type as needed."

    "section": "Principi di map design",
    "text": "Principi di map design\nQuando si progetta una mappa, l’obiettivo principale e’ quello di comunicare un messaggio.\n\nche domande bisogna porsi quando si disegna una mappa?\n\nCinque di questi principi principali sono legibility, visual contrast, figure-ground, hierarchical organization, and balance (https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/design-principles-for-cartography). Quando usati in maniera appropriata, questo sistema di principi favorisce e guida la lettura di una mappa sulla pagina in maniera chiara e in grado di comunicare il messaggio che il map maker vuole comunicare.\n\nVisual Contrast\nVisual contrast relates to how map featrues and page elements contrast with each other and their background. A well-designed map with a high visual contrast can result in a crisp, cleanm sharp-looking map. The higher the contrast between features, the more something will stand out. This is ususally the feature that is darker or brighter. Conversely, a map that has low visual contrast can be used to promote a more subtle impression. Features that have less contrast will appear to belong together.\n\n\nLegibility\nLegibility is “the ability to be seen and understood”. It depends on good decision-making for selecting symbols that are familiar to the rider, and choosing appropriate sizes so that the results are effortlessy seen and easily understood (example image). Geometric symbols are easier to read at smaller sizes; more complex symbols or incons require larger amounts of space to be legible (examples).\nIn linea di principio questi aspetti sono controllabili quando la mappa e’ stampata su un foglio di carta - un media ormai passato quasi obsoleto, dal momento che la gran parte della comunicazione visiva, mappe incluse, passa attraverso altri media come schermi digitali. Nel processo di mappatura, si effettuano diverse iterazioni - prove di stampa - per rifinire il contenuto e l’aspetto di una mappa, la grandezza dei simboli e delle labels, la dimensione e posizione della legenda, l’adeguatezza della scala di rappresentazione, eccetera. L’uso di strumenti e software digitale, come gis, cad, o graphica visiva (es. senza nominare illustrator o photoshop), nella costruzione della mappa, e l’uso di schermi per la sua comunicazione, spesso fanno tralasciare questi aspetti, risultando in immagini difficilmente legibili perche’ troppo piccole, o altro.\nIn questo senso, bisogna sempre considerare il supporto finale che ospitera’ la mappa. Finira’ in un libro? Che dimensioni avra’ questo libro? Quanto spazio posso usare nella pagina? Finira’ in un articolo scientifico? Sara’ proiettata su uno schermo di grandi dimensioni o di piccole dimensioni? eccetera.\nQuesti due principi sono propedetuici to other design principles: figure-ground, hierarchical organization, and balance.\nA map is a graphic representation, drawn to scale and traditionaly on a flat surface, of features of an area of the Earth. Such features can vary, they can be geographical - for instance, landforms, rivers, or geopolitical - administrative boundaries.\nDa un punto di vista tecnico, mappare significa riportare degli elementi\n\n\nFigure-ground\nFigure-ground organization is the spontaneous separation of the figure in the foreground from an “amorphous” background. Cartographers use this design principle to help their map readers find the area of the map or page to focus on.\nThere are many to promote figure-ground organization, such as adding detail to the map or using a white wash, a drop shadow, or feathering.\n\n\nHierarchical organization\nThe internal graphic structuring of the map - and the page layout more generally - is fundamental to helping people read your map. A hierarchy is the visual separation of your map into layers of information. Some types of features will be seen as more important that other kinds of features, and some features will seem more important than other features of the same type.\novviamente, questo dipende dal tipo di mappa sui cui dovete lavorare.\nHieararchical organization on reference maps (add link) works differently than on thematic maps (add link). For reference maps, many of the features should be no more important than one another and so, visually, they should lie on essentially the same visual plane. In reference maps, hierarchy is ususally more subtle and the map reader brings elements to the forefront by focusing attention on them.\nExample: a topographic map\nFor thematic maps, the theme is more important than the base that provides geographic context.\nExample: choroplet map\n\n\nBalance\nBalance involves the organization of the map and other elements on the page. A well-balanced map page results in an impression of equilibrium and harmony.\nWe can also use balance in different ways to promote “edginess” or “tension” or create an impression that is more “organic”. Balance results from two primary factors, visual weight and visual direction.\nIf you imagine that the center of your map page is balancing on a fulcrum, the factors that will “tip” the map in a particular direction include the relative location, shape, size, and subject matter of elements on the page.",
