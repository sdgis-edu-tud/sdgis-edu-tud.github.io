## 🧭 Activating Panels in QGIS

QGIS has a flexible and customizable interface. One of the most important parts of that interface is **panels** — tool windows that give you access to data, tools, and project controls.

This tutorial will guide you through activating three essential panels:\
🔍 **Browser Panel**\
📂 **Layer Panel**\
🛠️ **Processing Toolbox**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧱 What Are Panels?

Panels are parts of the QGIS interface that appear on the sides of the main window. Each panel has a specific function:

-   **Browser Panel** – Lets you quickly browse your computer for spatial files and databases to add to your project.
-   **Layer Panel** – Displays all the map layers you’re currently using. You can show/hide, reorder, or manage them from here.
-   **Processing Toolbox** – Gives you access to powerful spatial analysis tools, like buffering, clipping, and merging layers.

> 💡 If your screen looks empty or confusing when you first open QGIS, some of these panels might be hidden. Let’s turn them on!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Turn On the **Browser Panel**

1.  **Launch QGIS** on your computer.
2.  On the top menu bar, click **`View`**.
3.  Hover over **`Panels`**.
4.  Click **`Browser Panel`** to activate it.

✅ The **Browser Panel** should now appear (usually on the left). You can now explore folders and add spatial data files by dragging them into the map.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📂 Turn On the **Layer Panel**

1.  In QGIS, go to the **`View`** menu again.
2.  Hover over **`Panels`**.
3.  Click **`Layer Panel`**.

✅ The **Layer Panel** should appear — this is where you can manage what’s shown on your map. Right-click layers here to rename, style, or remove them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠️ Turn On the **Processing Toolbox**

1.  Click the **`Processing`** menu on the top bar.
2.  Select **`Toolbox`** from the dropdown.

✅ The **Processing Toolbox** will appear (usually on the right). This panel gives you access to dozens of analysis tools, from simple measurements to advanced geospatial functions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 Bonus: Customize Your Layout

-   **Docking Panels**: Drag panels around and dock them where it feels comfortable — left, right, top, or bottom.
-   **Floating Panels**: You can also leave a panel floating like a separate window.
-   **Save Layout**: Once you're happy with the setup, go to\
    `View \> Panels \> Save Panel Layout` to save your interface for future sessions.

> 📌 Tip: If your panels disappear by accident, just reopen them using the steps above!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✅ You're Ready!

Now your QGIS workspace is organized and ready to use. These three panels — **Browser**, **Layer**, and **Processing Toolbox** — are the foundation of your QGIS workflow.

> 🎓 *Tip for architecture students: Keeping your panels organized helps when managing multiple layers like building footprints, zoning areas, or transport networks.*
