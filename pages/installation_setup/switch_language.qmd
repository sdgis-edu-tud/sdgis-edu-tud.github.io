## 🌐 Change Language to English in QGIS

QGIS supports many languages and allows you to easily switch the interface to the one you're most comfortable with. If QGIS opens in a different language by default, follow the steps below to change it to English (or any other language of your choice).

## 🔄 Step-by-Step: Changing the Interface Language

### Open QGIS
Launch the QGIS application on your computer.

### Open the Settings/Preferences Window
- On **Windows**: Click on the **`Settings`** menu in the top menu bar.
- On **macOS**: Click on the **`QGIS`** menu in the top-left corner of the screen.

### Access Options (Windows) or Preferences (macOS)
- Select **`Options`** (Windows) or **`Preferences`** (macOS) from the drop-down menu.

This opens the **QGIS Settings dialog** where you can change various preferences.

### Go to Locale Settings
In the settings window, navigate to the tab or section labeled **`Locale`**, **`Locale Settings`**, or **`General`**, depending on your QGIS version.

### Change the Language
- Find the **Language** or **Locale** dropdown menu.
- Select **English** (or another preferred language) from the list.

> 💡 Tip: QGIS uses your system language by default. To override it, make sure the **"Override system locale"** checkbox is selected (if available).

### Apply the Changes
Click **`Apply`** or **`OK`** to save your settings.

### Restart QGIS
Close and reopen QGIS for the new language settings to take full effect.

- **Updates**: Language support improves with new releases. Make sure you're using the latest version of QGIS from [qgis.org](https://qgis.org/).
- **Need Help?**: If you encounter issues or can't find the setting, check the [official QGIS documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/) for your version.
