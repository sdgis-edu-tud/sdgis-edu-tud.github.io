# Introduction

**Map layout** or **map composition** is the part of [cartographic design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartographic_design) that involves assembling various map elements on a page.

Common map elements include **one or more data frames** (each containing an ordered set of map layers), a scale bar, north arrow, map title, descriptive text, and a legend. 

For geographic reference, you can add grids or graticules.

When designin a map, several questions can be asked:

> -   Will the map stand alone, or will it be part of a series of maps that share a similar design?
>
> -   What size will the printed map be? How will the page be oriented?
>
> -   How many data frames will your map have?
>
> -   Will the map have other elements such as a title, north arrow, and legend?
>
> -   Will the map contain graphs or reports to complement the geographic data?
>
> -   How will scale be indicated on the map?
>
> -   How will the map elements be organized on the page?
>
> -   Who are the end-users of our map?
>
> -   Are there any ‘unintended’ audiences (e.g., future employees, other colleagues, etc)?

## Map layout elements

### Title

-   Map title describes the theme or subject of a map.

-   It should instantly give the viewer a good idea of what the map is depicting.

-   The title is either the primary or secondary layout element (if secondary, it is only second to the map element)

-   It summarizes (in ten words or less) the primary findings of the analysis

-   Avoid any obvious and redundant terms (e.g., ‘map of…’, ‘analysis of…’)

## Subtitle

-   **The subtitle is comprised of any spillover text that is slightly less important than the title but still somewhat necessary to fully understand the map**

-   **Ideally, the subtitle provides further detail that the viewer needs to know prior to being able to understand the map**

-   **It is placed directly below or to the right of the title**

It is displayed in the **same font as the title** but carries **slightly less emphasis** than the title

## Legend

-   **It is comprised of items (icons, points, lines, polygons) and their associated descriptions**

-   **Only exclude map layers from a legend—or the legend itself from the layout—purposefully**

-   **Best practices: Items look best when placed to the left of their corresponding label.**

**Complicated legends** with many items necessitate **grouping levels**.\
Most common grouping levels are the **categorical group** (e.g., all land-use colors placed separately from all stream-level colors) and the **shape-type  group** (e.g., all polygon features placed separately from all line features)

## Inset maps

-   **An inset map in cartography is a smaller map featured within a larger map.**

-   **Zooming in on a specific area: It shows a detailed view of a particular region that may be too small to clearly represent on the main map. For example, an inset might zoom in on a city or area of interest within a larger regional or national map.**

-   **Providing context: It shows the location of the main map's area within a broader geographic context. For example, a small world map might be inset in a detailed country map to show where the country is located globally.**

**Highlighting related information**: Inset maps can show additional data or thematic content that complements the main map. For example, a weather map of a country may include an inset showing temperature trends in a specific region.

## Labels

-   **Identification of features\
    Labels provide names for cities, rivers, roads, landmarks.\
    Benefit: Helps users recognize and interpret map features.**

-   **Context and Orientation\
    Labels offer a spatial frame of reference.\
    Benefit: Aids in understanding relationships between areas and features.**

-   **Clarifying Thematic Data\
    Labels explain data on maps like population or climate zones.\
    Benefit: Helps users grasp patterns or trends in the data.**

-   **Prioritizing Information\
    Highlights key features (e.g., capital cities, major roads).\
    Benefit: Directs focus to the most relevant parts of the map.**

Conveying Additional Information\
Can include extra data (e.g., population, distances).\
Benefit: Enriches the map with supplementary details.

## Charts and Graphs

-   **Visualizing Complex Data\
    Simplifies large datasets for easy understanding.\
    Benefit: Highlights patterns and trends.**

-   **Enhancing Data Interpretation\
    Shows relationships between geographic locations and data.\
    Benefit: Provides clear insight into spatial patterns.**

-   **Combining Spatial and Quantitative Insights\
    Merges location with numbers.\
    Benefit: Analyzes how data varies by region.**

-   **Supporting Thematic Analysis\
    Adds context to thematic maps (e.g., demographics, economics).\
    Benefit: Offers detailed insights on specific topics.**

-   **Facilitating Comparisons Between Regions\
    Easy comparison of regions using charts like bar or pie charts.\
    Benefit: Shows socio-economic differences between areas.**

# Exercise

::: callout-warning
## Map Peer Review exercise

-   **Form groups (2-3 people)**

-   **Choose a map** from your work that you would like to receive feedback on from your peers

-   As a group, to **review the map evaluation criteria** provided in the review sheet (3 minutes)

-   **Present your map**, explaining key details and objectives (2 min)

-   **Give yourself a feedback** on areas you believe could be improved (2 min)

-   **Peer feedback**: Group members give their **constructive feedback** and suggestions (max 5 min)

-   **Write down the feedback and suggestions** received from both yourself and your peers on the map review sheet for future reference.
