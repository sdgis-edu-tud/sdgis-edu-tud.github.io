# Introduction

This chapter focuses on the stylistic and perceptual aspects of map design—those that influence clarity, hierarchy, emotion, and interpretation. These elements translate cartographic principles (Chapter 1) into concrete design decisions across the map elements (Chapter 2) and layout (Chapter 3).

## Fonts and Typography

### Font types

serif, sans-serif, decorative \### Font syze and hierarchy

### Font weight and emphasis

### Kerning, spacing, readability

### Typographic conventions in cartography

## Color Use in Maps

### Color systems

-   RGB
-   CMYK
-   HSL
-   HEX \### Color theory \### Sequential, diverging, and categorical schemes \### Color perception and accessibility \### Psychological and caltural meaning of colors

## Line and Stroke Styles

Line weight and hierarchy

Dash types and meanings (e.g., administrative boundaries vs physical features)

Contour and flow line visualization

Edge sharpness and layering

## Symbols and Iconography

Types of symbols: point, line, area

Pictorial vs geometric symbols

Symbol scaling and abstraction

Semiotics of symbols (iconic/indexical/symbolic)

## Texture and Pattern

Use of hatching, shading, dotted fills

Surface texture to suggest terrain, land use, or density

Interactions with color and scale

## Transparency and Layering

Visual hierarchy via opacity

Overlapping elements

Techniques for depth and dimensionality

## Animation and Interactivity

Animated transitions for layers or zoom

Interactive color and symbol changes

Mouseover and click-based symbol variation

Time-based variables (e.g., animated flows or change detection)

## Design Cohesion and Style Guides

How all these elements work together in design systems

Using style guides or cartographic templates

Creating and applying cartographic identities (e.g., for institutions, atlases, or web platforms)
