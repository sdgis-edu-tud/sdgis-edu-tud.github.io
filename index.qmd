## Data-Informed Design for Sustainable Urban Futures Graduation Cluster

The Data-Informed Design for Sustainable Urban Futures graduation cluster explores how spatial data, GIS, and computational methods can shape more sustainable and resilient cities. Students work at the intersection of urban design, data science, and environmental analysis to address complex challenges like climate adaptation, social equity, and urban transformation. What makes this cluster unique:

Integration of quantitative analysis with design thinking Focus on evidence-based approaches to urban sustainability Collaboration with municipalities, research institutes, and community organizations Development of innovative methods for spatial analysis and visualization

Whether you're interested in climate-responsive design, participatory planning, or smart city innovations, this cluster provides the tools and mentorship to develop research-driven graduation projects that contribute to sustainable urban futures.
